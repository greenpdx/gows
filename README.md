GO language WebSocket Web Application Framework

This is a websocket framework designed to work with nginx. It servers 
static pages/web apps and MVC data.  It is designed to support Postgres
Database.  New packages can be written and added to the main program.

I have written other MVC frameworks but this is my first attempt
to learn and write GO.
